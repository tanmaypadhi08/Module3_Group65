# 1 DESCRIPTION
Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. 
1. RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
   * Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
   * Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
2.	RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. 
3.	RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. 
4.	Typical RKE functions are: 	Print lock â€“ (Blue switch on- All led on at the same time)
    * Print unlock - (Blue switch press two times- All led off at the same time)
    * Print alarm activation/deactivation - (Blue switch press three times- All led on in clockwise manner)
    * Print approach light - (Blue switch press four times- All led on in anti-clockwise manner)

# 3 SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTH
* Remote Starting
* Time is saved during urgent situation
* Support for Effecient operation.

## WEAKNESS
* cost of system may be increased
* complex System
* issues of engine running after parking the car
* Beyond the certain distance we can't unlock or lock it.

## OPPORTUNITIES
* Advancement in Technology.
* It can provide to not only large automobiles but also for small ones when there is theft of vehicles.

## THREAT
* Targated Attacks
* Identity Theft
